    "We would like to measure the radius of the Earth. The `mass' of a ceramic mug was measured to be 469.90 grams on the 3rd floor of the North Building of ELTE's Lagymanyos campus in Budapest, and as 469.86 grams on the top of Janos Hill in Budapest using an exceptionally high resolution digital scale. Let us consider the shape of Janos Hill as a right cone with a half-opening angle of 45 degrees. What is the radius of the Earth and its experimental uncertainty?\n",
